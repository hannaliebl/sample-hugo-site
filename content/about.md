## About

This is the about page. It tells us about this great website. It's really a fun site!

Yes, so fun, that it needs a second paragraph to describe it. This site is lovingly crafted, and it runs on Hugo, the Golang-based static site generator. It also uses Bootstrap for the base styles and javascript interactions.
